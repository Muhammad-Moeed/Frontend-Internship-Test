    >>> CSS Grid Layout
        Potential Issue: Older versions of Safari and Firefox may have partial or buggy CSS Grid support.

    >>> Solution:
        Use @supports (display: grid) to provide fallback layouts (Flexbox).
        Add vendor prefixes (-webkit-, -moz-) if needed.
        Test in Safari (including iOS) and Firefox with responsive layouts.

    >>> Fetch API for Requests
        Older browsers (Safari , Firefox ) may have incomplete Fetch support.

    >>> Solution:
        Use axios or whatwg-fetch polyfill.
        Ensure error handling includes catch for network issues.

    >>> ES2020 Features (Optional Chaining, Nullish Coalescing)
        Safari (pre-13.1) and older Firefox versions donâ€™t support these.

    >>> Solution:
        Use Babel (@babel/preset-env) to transpile modern JS.
        Alternatively, replace ?. with && checks and ?? with || (if null/undefined checks are safe).

### Structured Testing Approach for Future Features
    >>> Use Can I Use + BrowserStack for compatibility checks.
