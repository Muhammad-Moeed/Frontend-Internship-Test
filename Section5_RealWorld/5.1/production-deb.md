### Production Debugging (5 points)

## Debugging Approach

    >>> First Check: users is undefined
        Render UserList without passing users (or pass undefined).

    >>> Expected: Error occurs → Fix by adding a default empty array (users || []).

    >>> Second Check: API
        Simulate a failed API request that should populate users.

    >>> Expected: Blank screen → Fix by adding error handling (e.g., display "No users found").
